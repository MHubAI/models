    "description": "This algorithm predicts the percentage of stromal area covered by tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) on H&E-stained whole-slide images of breast cancer histopathology. This algorithm first segments invasive tumor and tumor-associated stroma and subsequently detects lymphocytes and plasma cells, which are finally combined to estimate the relevant regions for TIL estimation. This model algorithm was the challenge winner of the TIGER challenge hosted on Grand Challenge.",
