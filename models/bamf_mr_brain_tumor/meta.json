For each example, four modalities were given: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), native (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), and T2-weighted (T2). Annotations consisted of four classes: 1 for necrotic tumor core (NCR), 2 for peritumoral edematous tissue (ED), 4 for enhancing tumor (ET), and 0 for background (voxels that are not part of the tumor).",
