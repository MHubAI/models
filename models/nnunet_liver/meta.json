A radiologist with over three years of expertise in oncologic imaging annotated the scans, categorizing each voxel as tumor, healthy liver, or background - with the tumor label covering all neoplastic growths, regardless of origin. These annotations were later reviewed by three other readers blinded to the initial segmentation, with the most senior reader serving as tie-breaker in cases of labelling conflicts. Scans with ambiguous lesion-like structures were excluded from the annotation process.
