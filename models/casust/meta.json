The model is intended to be used in the context of radiotherapy treatment planning, to support the delineation of the heart and its substructures and has been validated by two radiation oncologists."

The dataset contains a single pCT scan for 80 lung cancer patients and 80 lymphoma patients, resulting in a total of 160 fully annotated pCT scans in DICOM format. The ground truth delineations were performed by multiple radiation oncologists and residents with a different level of expertise (range 1-12 years). To the best of our knowledge, no standard protocol was followed. The most common spacing among 100 of all scans was 1.171875 x 1.171875 x 3.0. All training samples have been re-sampled to this precision."
