The model has been trained and tested on patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) referred for curative-intent radiotherapy, so it might not be suited for a healthy population. The generalization capabilities of the model on a range of ages, genders, and ethnicities are unknown. The slice thickness should not exceed 2.5mm for best results."

Images were provided by the Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France (CHB). On each CT scan, the OARs have been delineated by an experienced radiation oncologist using a Varian Medical Systems SomaVision platform. The body and lung contours were segmented with the automatic tools available on the platform. The esophagus was manually delineated from the 4th cervical vertebra to the esophago-gastric junction. The heart was delineated as recommended by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 2. The trachea was contoured from the lower limit of the larynx to 2cm below the carena excluding the lobar bronchi. The aorta was delineated from its origin above the heart down to below the diaphragm pillars.",
