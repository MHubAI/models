The CT images were randomly sampled from routine clinical studies, such that the dataset contains scans of patients with different ages, pathologies, of different body parts, acquired with different scanners, and sequences. The slice thickness should not exceed 1.5mm for best results."

The Nora Imaging Platform was used for manual segmentation or further refinement of generated segmentations, starting from data uniformely resampled to 1.5mm isotropic. Segmentation was supervised by two physicians with three and six years of experience in body imaging. If an existing model for a given structure was publicly available, that model was used to create a first segmentation, which was then validated and refined manually. Furthermore, the authors used an iterative learning approach to speed up the segmentation process [1][2]. The evaluation process was conducted on images resampled to 1.5mm isotropic.",
