For this baseline algorithm, a single I3D model, initialized with publicly available weights trained for RGB video classification, was trained to estimate both COVID-19 presence and severity. The model was trained on all training data for 40 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 10, momentum parameters \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.99, and a weight decay of 0.01. Data augmentation was employed in the form of zoom, rotation, translation, and adding gaussian noise. Patient age and sex information were not incorporated as input to the model.",
