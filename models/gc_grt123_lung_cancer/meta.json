    "description": "This algorithm analyzes non-contrast CT scans of the thorax and predicts the lung cancer risk. The model consists of two modules. The first one is a 3D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top five nodules based on the detection confidence, evaluates their cancer probabilities and combines them with a leaky noisy-or gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject. This model was the winner of the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition hosted on Kaggle.",

The nodule detection was evaluated on the validation of the DSB dataset, which contained data from 198 cases and there were 71 (7 nodules smaller than 6 mm are ruled out) nodules in total. The Free Response Operating Characteristic (FROC) is used to evaluate the performance of the nodule detection. The case cancer classification was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric on the training set and the testing set of respectively 1397 and 506 patient cases. The AUC and FROC graphs can be viewed in the publication [2]. For the final evaluation on the Data Science Bowl 2017 challenge, the model's performance was evaluated using the logistic loss on a private external dataset of 300 low-dose CT images [3], containing 100 cancer-positive scans and 200 cancer-negative scans.
