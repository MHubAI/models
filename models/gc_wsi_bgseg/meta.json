The second dataset consisted of 8 WSI with mostly different tissue types and all different staining methods, to evaluate generalization of the model. It contained tissue types lung, cornea, aorta, brain, skin, uterus, and kidney. The tissues were stained with Grocott, Alcian Blue, Von Kossa, Perls, and Chromotrope Aniline Blue (CAB) stains.
