  "summary": {
    "description": "This algorithm segments tumor lesions in whole-body FDG-PET/CT. To prevent over-segmenting tumor regions due to high-uptake organs or inflammations, the model uses a false positive reduction network. First a self-supervised pre-trained global segmentation module coarsely delineates the candidate tumor regions using a self-supervised pre-trained encoder. The candidate tumor regions are then refined by removing false positives via a local refinement module.",
